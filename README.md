# Personaltoken

I learned how to launch my first smart contract 

This contract is a standard erc20 token that i made in my name, and then I learned how to update values on the blockchain by creating a "doublemyfavoritenumber" function, which allows me to input a number and then update the favorite number function.

I really enjoyed trying this on Binance Smart Chain and learned a lot in trying to launch my first token

I deployed my favorite contract here: https://testnet.bscscan.com/tx/0x46a48379cd748d7541993e185230debe82db02e9e156cec1c80c341ad8726744
